# reddit-clone

## Getting started

This application is broken down into two components, the `/server` and the `/client`. Each folder has its own list of dependencies. To install all dependencies at once, clone the repo, and run `yarn setup` from the root directory.
Then head to `localhost:3000`.

## Background

This project was built on Node and React. In order to ensure a smooth development experience, I added such utilities as Webpack and Babel to enable hot-reloading, as well as Sass, CSS-modules and Styled-components to assist with the overall styling.
